LOCALISATION NOTES	(3 August 2007)
==================
This is a brief overview of some important points that MarcoPolo localisers should know. If you are a new localiser, or haven't read this file for a while, please review it.


OVERVIEW
--------
The end result of your localisation work will be a directory called "XX.lproj", where XX is the two-letter lowercase ISO 639-1 code for your language. Googling for "ISO 639-1" will provide lists for you to check. Some examples are English (en), German (de) and French (fr).

If you're creating a regional dialect localisation, the directory should be called "XX_YY.lproj", where YY is the two-letter uppercase regional designator as specified by ISO 3166-1. For example, Brazilian Portguese will be in a directory called "pt_BR.lproj".

There are two main parts that need to be localised: the Strings file, and the Nibs. Both of these have sections below.


STRINGS FILE
------------
The strings file, called "Localizable.strings", is a UTF-16 text file, and must be kept in that format. That means that you'll need to edit it in a program that supports UTF-16 properly. Xcode and TextEdit are two examples that are known to work well.

Each English phrase that needs translating into your language will appear in the strings file as follows:
	/* Growl message title */
	"Changing Context" = "Changing Context";
The first line, inside the "/*" and "*/" bits are programmer-provided comments to help you understand where the phrase is used. You should not edit this.
The second line consists of two strings, each marked with double quotes, and separated by an equals sign. The left-hand string is the English phrase; don't change this. The right-hand string is the localised phrase; you need to edit this.

Make sure you keep your translation consistent with things such as punctuation, spaces, parentheses, quotes, and so on. Double quote marks *inside* a phrase should be escaped with a backslash. For example, "Doing \"%@\" now.".

If the English phrase has a "format specifier" (usually "%@" or "%d", etc.), that indicates a point where something else will be inserted programmatically. You need to keep that in your translation, but it can be in any position inside the string, as appropriate.
