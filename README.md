ControlPlane
============

What is ControlPlane
--------------------

ControlPlane, a fork of MarcoPolo, brings context-senstive awareness to OS X.  With ControlPlane you can intelligently reconfigure your Mac or perform any number of actions based on input from a wide array of evidence sources including but not limited to available WiFi networks, connected monitors, connected and nearby bluetooth devices, currently running apps and other configurable sources.  

How ControlPlane Works
----------------------

Using fuzzy logic, ControlPlane decides where you are and what you are doing (called a Context) using rules that you configure to then carry out any number of configured actions

An example of how to use ControlPlane may include disabling the screensaver password while at work but enabling it when away from work.  Another example would be to set your Adium status and lock your screen if your cell phone out of bluetooth range.
